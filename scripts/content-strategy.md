## Context

Aistrology is a full-stack AI-powered astrology platform with educational content, interactive birth chart visualization, real-time AI astrologer chat, compatibility analysis, and a subscription system. The goal is to create short-form video content (TikTok/Reels) and distribute it across Reddit to drive awareness and signups.

## PART 1: Video Content Plan

### Phase 1 — Launch Week (Days 1–7)

| # | Video Title | Format | Description | CTA |
|---|------------|--------|-------------|-----|
| 1 | **"I Built an AI Astrologer"** | Founder story / screen recording | Show the app from signup to first chart generation. Walk through entering birth data, watching the SVG chart render, then asking the AI "What does my chart say about me?" Show the streaming AI response. Overlay text: "I built an AI that reads your birth chart." | "Link in bio — try it free" |
| 2 | **"Your Sun Sign is Only 1/3 of You"** | Educational + app demo | Explain the Big Three (Sun, Moon, Rising) with quick zodiac icon cuts. Then show how the app calculates all three from your birth data. End with: "Most people only know their Sun sign. Here's what you're missing." | "Get your full Big Three free" |
| 3 | **"I Asked AI About My Love Life"** | Chat screen recording | Open the app, select a birth chart, type "What does my Venus placement say about my love life?" Show the AI streaming a personalized answer. Reaction overlay. | "Ask the AI about yours" |

### Phase 2 — Education Series (Days 8–21)

| # | Video Title | Format | Description | CTA |
|---|------------|--------|-------------|-----|
| 4 | **"The 4 Elements Explained in 30s"** | Quick cuts + zodiac icons | Fire (Aries/Leo/Sag) = passion, Earth (Taurus/Virgo/Cap) = stability, Air (Gemini/Libra/Aqua) = intellect, Water (Cancer/Scorpio/Pisces) = emotion. Use the app's element distribution feature to show a real chart breakdown. | "See your element balance" |
| 5 | **"What Your Rising Sign Actually Means"** | Talking head + app demo | Explain that Rising = your mask/first impression. Show the app revealing someone's Rising sign and the AI explaining what it means for their personality. | "Find your Rising sign free" |
| 6 | **"Your Moon Sign Controls Your Emotions"** | Storytime + screen recording | "I always thought I was super logical because I'm a Virgo… then I found out my Moon is in Pisces." Show the app's AI explaining the Moon placement. | "Discover your Moon sign" |
| 7 | **"12 Houses, 12 Life Areas"** | Fast montage | Quick flash through all 12 houses with one keyword each (1st=Identity, 2nd=Money, 3rd=Communication…). Use the app's house guide pages as visuals. End: "Which house matters most to you?" | "Explore all 12 houses" |
| 8 | **"Mercury Retrograde is NOT What You Think"** | Myth-busting | Debunk common Mercury retrograde fears. Use the app's planets guide content. Show the AI's take on what Mercury retrograde actually means for a specific chart. | "Ask the AI about your Mercury" |
| 9 | **"POV: You Check Your Compatibility"** | Screen recording + reactions | Enter two birth charts. Show the AI calculating the compatibility score (0-100). React to the synastry aspects. "We got a 87… and we're destiny signs?!" | "Check your compatibility" |

| 12 | **"Things Only [Sign] People Understand"** | Relatable series (12 videos, 1 per sign) | Each video targets one zodiac sign with relatable traits pulled from the app's zodiac guide data. End by showing what the AI says about that sign's chart. | "See your full sign profile" |
| 13 | **"What Your Birth Chart Says You Should Do for a Living"** | Career reading | Show the app's AI interpreting Midheaven (MC) placement and 10th house. "Your chart says you should be a…" | "Ask AI about your career" |

## Video Production Tips

- **Hook in first 1.5 seconds** — Start with the result or a provocative statement ("AI just exposed my entire love life")
- **Show the app UI** — The cosmic/aurora design is visually striking; let it sell itself
- **Text overlays** — Always add captions; 80%+ of TikTok is watched on mute
- **Trending audio** — Use trending sounds; astrology + mystical sounds work well
- **Duration** — TikTok sweet spot: 15-45 seconds. Longer content (1-3 min) for YouTube Shorts / detailed readings
- **Post times** — 7-9 AM, 12-2 PM, 7-10 PM (audience timezone)
- **Hashtags** — #astrology #birthchart #zodiac #astrologytiktok #aitool #[specific sign] #fyp

1. **95/5 Rule** — 95% genuine participation, 5% mentioning your product
2. **Build karma first** — Spend 2-4 weeks answering questions before any self-promotion in astrology subs
3. **Never use marketing language** — Redditors detect and destroy corporate speak instantly
4. **Cross-post TikTok content** — Reels/TikToks with app demos work well in r/astrologymemes and sign-specific subs
5. **Offer genuine value** — Free tools, free readings, educational content > "download my app"
6. **Use multiple accounts carefully** — Reddit flags ban-evading and spam rings. One authentic account is better

## Email Strategy

  1. Import CSVs into your email tool — Take scripts/output/warm_users.csv (29 contacts) and import it. Map the columns: email, name, sun_sign,
   moon_sign, ascendant_sign.
  2. Choose an email tool — If you haven't picked one yet, good free options for 40 users:
    - Brevo (free up to 300 emails/day) — has automation sequences
    - Mailchimp (free up to 500 contacts) — easy template editor
    - Resend — developer-friendly, 3k emails/month free
  3. Set up the 6-email drip sequence — Copy content from scripts/email_templates/01_welcome.md through 06_final_offer.md, paste into your
  tool, set the day delays (0, 3, 6, 8, 11, 14).
  4. Send HOT user emails manually — Open hot_personal.md, personalize slightly for each of the 6 users, send from your personal email. Start
  with Надежда (9 conversations, most active).
  5. Send cold re-engagement — Import cold_users.csv (4 contacts), send the cold_reengagement.md email.

  Before sending

  6. Replace placeholders — Verify your email tool correctly replaces {name}, {sun_sign}, {moon_sign} with the CSV fields. Send a test to
  yourself first.
  7. Update Email 2 transit reference — The 02_value_demo.md template mentions a generic "Mars entering a new sign". Check what's actually
  happening astronomically this week and make the subject line specific.
  8. Update Email 6 deadline — The 06_final_offer.md says "до края на тази седмица". Set the actual date when you schedule it.

  Priority order

  Start with step 4 (HOT personal emails) — highest ROI, zero tool setup needed. You can literally send those today from Gmail.
